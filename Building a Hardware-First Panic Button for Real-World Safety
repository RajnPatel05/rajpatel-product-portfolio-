# üÜò From App to Action: Building a Hardware-First Panic Button for Real-World Safety

## üß† At a Glance
To address compliance gaps, device misuse, and scalability challenges, I led the end-to-end rollout of Wrkspot‚Äôs **Standalone Panic Button** ‚Äî a hardware device that operates independently of smartphones. This initiative enabled Wrkspot to serve unionized hotels, cut installation costs, and elevate the brand‚Äôs credibility in the hospitality safety tech market.


## üéØ What We Set Out to Solve
- üö´ Eliminate mobile phone dependency for panic button use
- üíº Overcome union and labor compliance limitations
- üöÄ Expand Wrkspot‚Äôs safety offerings to new customer segments
- üìâ Cut the cost and complexity of installation

### üìä Key Metrics
- ‚úÖ 100% mobile-free panic button usage
- üí∏ 30% decrease in hardware costs
- üè® Passed compliance testing in 3 hotel environments
- üìà 20+ new unionized hotel accounts unlocked

## üë®‚Äçüíº My Contributions
**Role:** Associate Product Manager  
**Focus:** Hardware innovation, compliance, field testing, vendor management

**Key Contributions:**
- Initiated and ran the vendor evaluation process
- Coordinated QA, LTE signal testing, and safety simulations
- Drafted product briefs and compliance documentation
- Built internal training guides and rollout playbooks
- Collaborated with Engineering, R&D, CS on GTM execution

## üß© The Challenge
Wrkspot‚Äôs original panic system required Bluetooth pairing with a phone app.  
This:
- Delayed deployment due to setup complexity
- Created friction for staff and encouraged misuse
- Required company-issued smartphones (especially in unionized hotels)

**Solution:** A discreet LTE-enabled badge-style panic button that operates independently.

## üîç Discovery Highlights
- Conducted interviews with hotel GMs, union reps, and HR managers
- Audited installation feedback and pairing failure rates
- Researched panic button regulations in NYC, LA, and other cities

## üî¨ From Idea to Execution

### üîç Vendor Sourcing
- Reached out to 8+ manufacturers
- Assessed: ADA compliance, battery life, form factor, LTE signal strength
- Chose a badge-style device with a hidden red button on the back

### üß™ Testing & Validation
- QA tests for latency, LTE signal loss, and battery life
- Field simulations in:
  - Courtyard hotel
  - Beach resort
  - High-rise property
- Confirmed direct backend integration via LTE

### üì¶ GTM Enablement
- Created:
  - Install guides
  - Safety checklists
  - Loom walkthroughs
- Trained Implementation and CS teams
- Built product messaging and sales enablement decks

- ‚úÖ LTE SIM Cost Comparison  
- üñ• Loom Training Walkthroughs  
- üìù Installation & Safety PDF Guide  
- üì¶ Product Brief & Sales Pitch Deck  

## üí¨ Stakeholder Insight
> "We‚Äôve wanted to offer Wrkspot for years, but mobile device policies and union compliance blocked us. The new panic button changed everything ‚Äî we rolled it out in less than a week."
> ‚Äî *Director of Ops, Union Hospitality Group* (Fictionalized)

## üí≠ Final Takeaways

### ‚úÖ What Worked
- Solved real compliance + labor issues with a hardware-first solution
- Sourced and validated hardware quickly
- Enabled smooth GTM with field-ready documentation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Be Improved
- Bring in Marketing earlier for external-facing rollout
- Add in-app feedback tools for real-time device performance tracking
