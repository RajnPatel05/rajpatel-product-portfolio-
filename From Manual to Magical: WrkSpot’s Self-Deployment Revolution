# 🚀 From Manual to Magical: WrkSpot’s Self-Deployment Revolution

## 🧠 Overview
Led the design, strategy, and launch of a self-deployment feature for WrkSpot, a SaaS platform in hospitality. This product enabled hotel clients to onboard themselves in 3 days (down from 1–2 weeks), improving scalability across 350+ properties and reducing internal costs and labor.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Eliminate manual onboarding and hardware configuration
- Improve client time-to-value (TTV)
- Standardize onboarding across properties
- Enable direct shipping from vendor to hotel

**Key KPIs:**
- ⏱️ Onboarding time: 1–2 weeks → 3 days  
- 📈 60% self-deployment adoption in 60 days  
- 🧑‍💼 30% reduction in onboarding support tickets  
- 💰 50%+ drop in implementation labor and costs  

## 👤 My Role
**Title:** Associate Product Manager  
**Responsibilities:**
- Led full product lifecycle (discovery → launch)
- Defined roadmap, wrote PRDs, and created wireframes
- Conducted UAT, A/B testing, and field validation
- Collaborated with Engineering, QA, Design, CS, and Implementation

**Tools Used:**  
Figma, JIRA, Notion, Loom, Confluence, Google Sheets

## 🔍 Problem
Wrkspot’s original onboarding process was highly manual:
- Internal setup of hardware (e.g., panic buttons)
- Live walkthroughs required from CS team
- Delays and bottlenecks limited scaling

As demand grew, the need for a client-led onboarding experience became critical.

## 💡 Approach

### 🔬 Research & Discovery
- Interviewed 12+ hotel GMs and HR managers
- Audited 40+ support tickets for onboarding confusion
- Shadowed CS team on live onboarding calls
- Conducted field visits to observe real hotel environments

### 🛠 Planning & Design
- Prioritized MVP using MoSCoW framework
- Built validated Figma wireframes with tooltips and progress tracking
- Created Loom tutorials for each step
- Designed A/B tests for legacy vs. self-deployment onboarding

### 🚀 Execution
- Completed 3 agile sprints
- UAT with 5 enterprise clients
- A/B testing with Mixpanel analytics
- Deployed QR-code pairing and device assignment
- Enabled vendor-to-hotel shipping with no Wrkspot touchpoint
