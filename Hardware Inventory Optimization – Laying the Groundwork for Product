# 📌 Hardware Inventory Optimization – Laying the Groundwork for Product

## 🔍 Summary
At Wrkspot, hardware inventory was tracked inconsistently, leading to lost devices, audit issues, and operational inefficiencies. I led the creation of an automated workflow to manage the entire device lifecycle — from ordering to damage — which later became the foundation for Wrkspot’s client-facing Asset Management product.

## 🎯 Goals
- Replace manual processes with structured, automated workflows
- Eliminate inventory-related errors and improve traceability
- Provide reliable data for Finance and Accounting teams
- Design a scalable system with product potential

### 📊 Key Metrics
- 📉 90% reduction in inventory-related issues  
- ⏱ Inventory reconciliation time reduced from days to minutes  
- ✅ Real-time visibility into inventory status (ordered, in stock, deployed, damaged)  
- 🔁 Internal workflow evolved into client-facing Asset Management product  

## 👨‍💼 My Role
**Title:** Associate Product Manager / Ops Lead  
**Focus Areas:** Process Design • Workflow Automation • Cross-Functional Alignment

### Contributions:
- Audited inventory workflows and diagnosed root causes
- Built a Google Sheets tracker with change logs and approval flows
- Worked with Finance to align physical inventory and PO history
- Standardized processes across offshore and U.S. fulfillment teams
- Proposed long-term vision for productizing the internal workflow

## ❗ The Challenge
No system existed — only ad hoc spreadsheets and verbal updates:
- Frequent device loss and miscounts
- No real-time visibility or lifecycle tracking
- Financial and logistical mismatches led to delays and reordering issues

## 🔧 Approach

### 🧠 Discovery
- Interviewed Finance, Fulfillment, and Customer Success teams
- Identified root issues in ordering, labeling, and tracking
- Audited previous quarter’s inventory to locate recurring errors

### 🛠 Workflow Creation
- Built centralized dashboard to track:
  - Ordered stock
  - Active deployment
  - Damaged goods
  - Reorder points
- Implemented change logs and auto-alerts for reorder triggers
- Added team-specific filters for Finance, CS, and Fulfillment

### 📣 Enablement
- Trained U.S. and offshore teams on using the new system
- Delivered audit-ready, version-controlled templates
- Aligned logic with QuickBooks and financial reporting standards

## ✅ Results

| Outcome              | Impact                                |

## 📎 Key Artifacts
- 📊 Google Sheets Inventory Tracker Template  
- 🧭 Notion Workflow Diagram  
- 🔐 Version Control Guide & Change Log Protocol  
- 📈 MVP Asset Management Product Proposal  
- 🧾 Audit Sheet Format for Accounting Integration  

## 💬 Reflection

### ✅ What Worked
- Converted an inefficient internal process into a scalable, adopted workflow
- Cross-functional collaboration solved pain points across multiple departments
- Internal innovation served as springboard for a full-fledged product

### ⚠️ What Could Be Improved
- Push for a lightweight backend app earlier
- Integrate inventory tracker with invoicing and reporting tools

**Key Takeaway:**  
This project reinforced how operational excellence can drive product development. It taught me how to take messy systems, align stakeholders, and deliver tools that scale into customer-facing value.
