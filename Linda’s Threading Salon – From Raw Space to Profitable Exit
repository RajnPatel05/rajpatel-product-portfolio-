# 💈 Linda’s Threading Salon – From Raw Space to Profitable Exit

## 🧠 Snapshot
In under 90 days, I launched a high-margin threading salon in Fullerton, CA, starting from an unlicensed, empty unit. The business became profitable within 3 months and was sold for 2x my original investment within a year — all during a 6-month rent-free window.

## 🎯 Goals & Milestones
- Launch and license a salon in < 3 months
- Reach profitability before rent activation
- Build local brand awareness with $0 ad spend
- Design and execute a business exit strategy in under 12 months

### 📊 Key Results
- 🧾 Fully licensed and operational in <90 days
- 💵 Profitable by Month 3
- 👥 90+ monthly customers by Month 5
- 🔁 Business sold at 2x ROI within a year

## 👨‍💼 My Role
**Title:** Founder & Operator  
**Focus Areas:** Business Strategy • Vendor Management • Local Marketing • GTM Execution

### Key Contributions:
- Negotiated rent-free lease to de-risk launch
- Managed permits, health inspections, and zoning approvals
- Oversaw phased contractor work (plumbing, signage, electrical)
- Built lean GTM strategy (Google Business, Yelp, flyers, referrals)
- Operated salon and managed POS, rebooking, and customer experience
- Created full asset and SOP package for new owner

## ❗ The Challenge
With no brand, customer base, or paid ads, I needed to:
- Get operational before the rent-free window ended
- Navigate complex licensing and inspection processes
- Attract foot traffic and repeat customers with minimal spend
- Build transferable systems for resale

## 🔍 Market & Opportunity
- 12 competing salons in a 2-mile radius
- Identified gap in fast-service, walk-in friendly threading salons
- Positioned salon with prices 15% below local average
- Created partnerships with local coffee shops and gyms

## 🏗️ Launch Execution

### 🧾 Permits & Planning
- Designed compliant layout using SmartDraw
- Secured all city and health permits in under 60 days
- Used fixed-cost contracts with payment milestones

### 🧱 Buildout
- Collected and compared contractor bids to manage costs
- Personally tracked materials and vendor supply chain
