# 💡 Scaling Smart: How Modular Pricing Opened New Markets for Wrkspot

## 🎯 Context & Motivation
As Wrkspot grew, our all-in-one pricing limited accessibility for smaller hotels and adjacent markets. I partnered with the CEO to design and launch the **Trinity Subscription Model** — a modular pricing and packaging strategy that made Wrkspot more flexible, scalable, and attractive to new segments.

## 🧠 Key Objectives
- Package Wrkspot’s offerings into intuitive, need-based tiers
- Align pricing with smaller hotels and non-hospitality verticals
- Enable sales with clear messaging and upgrade paths
- Launch GTM strategy targeting underpenetrated markets

### 📊 Success Metrics
- 🏨 Increased adoption among <50-room hotels
- 📈 Higher conversion rates for small-to-mid-size leads
- 💼 Expansion into verticals (assisted living, property management)
- 💰 Monetization flexibility for light and heavy users

## 👨‍💻 My Role
**Title:** Associate Product Manager  
**Scope:** Strategy, Research, GTM Enablement

### Key Contributions:
- Collaborated with CEO on pricing vision and tier design
- Conducted 20+ user interviews to identify value drivers
- Defined and named WrkOps, WrkShield, and WrkForce tiers
- Built internal enablement kits and rollout materials
- Supported pilot launches and iterated based on early results

## 🧩 The Challenge
Our platform was optimized for enterprise clients. As we scaled:
- Smaller clients were overwhelmed and priced out
- Adjacent markets didn’t see product fit
- Lack of modularity limited flexibility

**Goal:** Unbundle the product and create purpose-built entry points.

## 🧠 Our Strategy

### 🔍 Discovery
- Interviewed hotel owners, operators, and adjacent industry leaders
- Reviewed sales objections and lead drop-off data
- Benchmarked SaaS pricing strategies in hospitality and proptech

| WrkShield   | Safety: panic buttons, alerts, compliance tools  |
